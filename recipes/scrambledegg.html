    <h1>Air Fryer Scrambled Eggs On The Go</h1>
    <img src="../img/scrambledegg.webp" alt="Garlic Chili Oil Noodles">

    <p>This simple air fryer eggs on the go recipe allows you to have a warm protein-packed meal to kick-start your day while your coffee is brewing. I like to place 2 fully cooked turkey sausage links in the basket alongside the ramekin for an added boost of energy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step To Make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly spray a ramekin dish with non-stick cooking spray. Pour in beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>Set air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C) and place the ramekin into the air fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Air fry for 3 minutes. Stir egg mixture and cook for 3 minutes more. Fluff with a fork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Grab and go. </li>
    </ol>
